To make this Github repository I used HTML,CSS,Jekyll and Markdown.

Jekyll is a very powerful static site generator.Using Jekyll with Github will automatically re-generate all the HTML pages for my website each time I commit a file.

For the posts on blog I used Markdown. Markdown is very helpful as it helps me write my HTML content quickly, making Markdown very suitable as a blog authoring syntax.This file which you are reading itself is stored with the file extension .md which stands for Markdown.
